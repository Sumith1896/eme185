:title: Recycler's Transporation Cart
:org: D-Lab
:location: Cali, Columbia

Recyclers in Cali, Colombia are a well organized guild of waste
pickers/collectors that work formally with the government and are part of the
waste management system.

They generally work with carts that they build themselves out of recycled
waste.

These designs do the job but improvements on ergonomics, ease of transport and
other needs exist such as the ability to keep a cart from rolling down hill.
