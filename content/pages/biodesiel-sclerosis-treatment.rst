Biodesiel Sclerosis Treatment
=============================

Biodiesel spoils (polymerizes) in less than a year and glues the fuel path,
killing the vehicle. We have a list of solvents that when added to the fuel
reverse the process and can be combusted. The project will involve testing
various additives for biodesiel for adequte fuel injector flow and/or
combustion. The sponsor has row of dead vehicles with biodiesel disease to test
the new product on.
