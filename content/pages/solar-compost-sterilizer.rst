Solar sterilizer for compost, humanure etc. - I have yet to see a composting
toilet that verifiably eliminates pathogens.

The sponsor has a lab and testing setup in Alameda and would like the students
to spend time there working on the projects, where they will be deployed. If
you select this project you will need to be willing to travel to Alameda using
your own means.
