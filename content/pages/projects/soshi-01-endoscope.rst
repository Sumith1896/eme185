Clinical Problem/Translational Importance
=========================================

Therapeutic endoscopic procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract are
becoming more common practice and include mucosal resection and submucosal
dissection for resecting early neoplastic lesions. With the currently available
methods, however, despite the usage of double-channel endoscope, manipulation
of the lesion being resected is quite limited by the nature of the single point
manipulation of an endoscope, leading to prolonged or discontinuation of a
procedure.

In the future, with emerging modes of screening test becoming available, more
number of early gastrointestinal tract tumors will be discovered, leading to
increased endoscopic therapies than open surgical interventions, which would be
reserved for more advanced stage tumors. In addition, having a second
independent grasper capability will improve upon the closure of resected
location by allowing approximation of the margins more easily – this will, in
turn, enables the secure closure of an intentional or unintentional wall defect
created during the therapeutic procedure.

In order to optimize the endoscopic therapy, improvements in the development of
the endoscopic accessories are needed for minimizing the time of the procedure
and the ease of operative maneuvering.

Desired Outcome
===============

Our intended goal is to design and produce a 3-dimentional maneuverable forceps
– which upon exiting from the channel or accessary port of an endoscope, be
able to grasp the tissue being resected/dissected and move it away from the
therapeutic endoscopic field for easier completion of the treatment as well as
brings together the margins of widely resected mucosa/submucosa of
gastrointestinal tract. Such a device would have additional utility in any
single-port procedures used in other interventional procedures.
