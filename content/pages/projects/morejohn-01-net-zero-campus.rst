Description
===========

In November 2013, UC President Napolitano announced an ambitious initiative for
a carbon neutral UC system by 2025
(http://www.ucop.edu/initiatives/carbon-neutrality-initiative.html) and each
campus must do its part to evaluate strategies for carbon reduction. UC Davis
is taking a leading role on several fronts, including the installation of the
largest solar PV system on any US college campus
(http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id=15351). One of the most
significant projects we can undertake is the conversion of our natural gas
powered steam district heating system to a hot water district heating system
which will open the door to a multitude of lower carbon and carbon free heating
sources and allow us to cut our large natural gas carbon footprint down to
almost nothing. However, this conversion project will require a thorough
evaluation of the different scenarios in terms of carbon, economics and
feasibility. A base model for the campus has been built in EnergyPro
(http://www.emd.dk/energypro/) and a capstone project team can utilize this
modeling software to evaluate these scenarios and offer recommendations to the
campus as to the best path forward to a ZNE campus.
