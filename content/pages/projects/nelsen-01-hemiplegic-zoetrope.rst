I want to build a large scale human-powered zoetrope that simulates the
sensation of walking within a hemiplegic body. The zoetrope will be engineered
in such a way that a modified elliptical trainer (or a machine approximating
itâ€™s motion) will spin the mechanism, and the animation viewed by the
able-bodied human powering the zoetrope will be a sculptural representation of
a hemiplegic person walking (probably modeled after myself.)

My intent is to have this be on display for an art exhibit and forum at Third
Space Art Collective that will focus on the art of young stroke survivors and
the important role that the creative process plays in redefining one's life
after stroke. I'm applying for grants that would help with the financial
demands of the project and those of organizing the art exhibit and forum.
