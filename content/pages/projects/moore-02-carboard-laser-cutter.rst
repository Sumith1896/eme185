The new MAE Design Studio space (Bainer 2071) is in need of some low overheard
prototyping tools to support the various design projects in the department.
Arizona State University has had success with CNC laser cut and engraved
cardboard for prototyping purposes. This project would involved designing and
constructing a safe, inexpensive, fast, and reliable CNC controlled cardboard
laser cutter. The tool should be able to cut through up to 1/4" thick
4'x4'cardboard sheets and also to "engrave" (cut part way through the
thickness) for easy bend lines. The users of the tool should be able to easily
supply a 2D CAD drawing from a number of popular formats for processing. The
device should be superbly safe such that it is impossible for users to be hurt
in any way during the operation of the laser cutter.
