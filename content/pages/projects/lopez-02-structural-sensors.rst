Objective
=========

Investigation and design and fully embedded sensor for structural health
monitoring

Constraints/Goals
=================

Sensor must be placed in AM component during fabrication and not after
fabrication

Design to include literature review (academic/commercial), design, and analysis
(proof of concept analysis)
