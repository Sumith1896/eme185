The Hyperloop Pod Team at UC Davis aims to compete in the 2016 SpaceX Hyperloop
Pod challenge; the purpose of this senior design project will be to design and
fabricate every component of a chassis subsystem for this high speed transport
pod. This chassis must support several subsystems of the pod such as air
levitation, braking, navigation, and an exterior shell which should total to
130 kg. A transport pod is a conceptual object which must levitate along a
track via air bearings at speeds peaking at 250 mph and easily exceeding 2.4
gâ€™s. Design goals will focus on developing a proof of concept prototype that is
stable and safe, yet deft and lightweight. Hyperloop was only proposed in
mid-2013, meaning a transport pod design is a novel concept which will explore
new grounds in the realm of transportation technology.
