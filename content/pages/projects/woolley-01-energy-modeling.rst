Project Objectives
==================

1. Adapt US DOE EnergyPlus models for Standard Commercial Building Types to
   represent California Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards.
2. Using OpenStudio and EnergyPlus, adapt these standard building models to
   represent buildings that achieve Zero Net Energy.
3. Develop EnergyPlus model of an innovative Zero Net Energy commercial
   building in Davis CA, and validate the model performance against real-world
   energy use data for the facility.

Project Narrative
=================

In coordination with Californiaâ€™s Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32), the
California Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan (CA-EESP) has established a number
of targets to transform the patterns energy use in California buildings.  In
particular, the CA-EESP plans to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) for all
residential construction by 2020, then to require ZNE for all new commercial
buildings by 2030. The capstone design project will develop building energy
simulations in EnergyPlus and OpenStudio to assess innovative design strategies
to achieve these goals.  In particular, we will study the design of a light
commercial building in Davis that incorporates passive design elements such as
high mass and natural ventilation to achieve substantial annual energy savings.
The project will develop a detailed model of this building, and will compare it
against building models that represent current Building Energy Efficiency
Standards.
