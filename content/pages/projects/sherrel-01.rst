Join us for the 5th annual Northern California Solar Regatta. The competition
will take place on Saturday, May 14, 2016 at Rancho Seco Recreational Area in
Herald, CA. SMUD will loan the collegiate team two solar modules that the team
will then use to make a solar-powered boat. If funding is a potential issue
know the boat can be as elaborate or as simple as desired. Some teams build
custom carbon fiber shells while other teams build their boats out of recycled
soda bottles. Additionally every team has the opportunity to earn up to $300 in
stipends and the Regatta Cup winner will earn an additional $600. SMUD also
provides breakfast and lunch for up to 30 people (25 registered students, 5
registered mentors), accommodations at the camp site the night before
competition, and a discount at the local Port Supply. The competition is broken
down into four categories: sprint, slalom, endurance, and presentation.
Additional awards are also given to teams with the best artistic or su stainabl
e boat, team spirit, and best video. Entry is free all teams need to do is fill
out the two page application found on the Northern California Solar Regatta web
page. For complete rules packet, application, and previous winners, please
visit http://smud.org/workshops. This competition is a great way for students
to earn hands-on sustainable engineering experience. We would love to see the
first UC Davis team competing against CSU, Sacramento, CSU, Chico, and 17 more
Northern California colleges.
