ICUEMOTION is a small lab in San Francisco that studies sports skills. Part of
building a biomechanical model of the player involves having accurate
measurements of the inertia of various sporting equipment. We are interested in
having students build a machine which automatically finds the inertia tensor
for a tennis racquet, golf club, baseball bat, etc. The solution should allow a
technician to place the racquet/club/bat into the machine, the machine to
perform its measurements with no human inputs, and then display the inertia
tensor to the technician.
