Current power wheelchairs depend on custom parts, available only with a
doctor's prescription and a multi-week (or month) delay between breakdown and
repair.

Parts are expensive and proprietary, and the parts are often unavailable a few
years after the chair is purchased.

Further, the chairs are often not designed for "real" use outside, only for
getting around within a home.

WHIM is trying to design and prototype an "Open Source" power wheelchair, which
can be built, maintained and modified using off-the-shelf components.  Once the
concept has been proven, we would publish the plans for anybody to use and
modify.

We have many of the tools and materials, and can get others once we decide on a
direction.

We need some dedicated mechanical engineering and problem solving.  Some
knowledge of robotics or wheelchair mechanics would be helpful.  An agile mind
and a sense of humor are a recommended.

The Principals:

Pamela K Walker is an artist, author, activist, and wheelchair user.  She
provides the practical experience, the knowledge of the requirements, and the
charisma.

Michael J Horton is a computer geek (mostly software), with just enough
knowledge of electronics and mechanical engineering to make him dangerous.  He
provides the vision, the toys, and the other stuff.  He also provides some
tools, but not the expertise to use them.

They are joined by a team of mechanical and electrical engineers who have
graciously volunteered their time, then moved on to other pursuits.
