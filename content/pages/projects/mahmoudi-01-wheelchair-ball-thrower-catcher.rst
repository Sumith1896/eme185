This proposal was written in collaboration between a teacher and a student.
The student is a very social 7th grader with a unique physical impairment which
requires him to use a power wheelchair. He has limited use of his hands and
feet, but is able to drive and navigate his power wheelchair independently. He
wants nothing more than to make it easier to hang out with his friends but also
improve his day to day life. The student would like to participate more in
Physical Education, in a way that is meaningful, rather than him being a 'ref'
for activities. We are wondering if with this project a team could try to make
some adaptations for his wheelchair that would help him participate more in PE.

If accepted, we think the program would be very beneficial in several ways.
First the student has aspirations to one day become an Engineer. He has expressed on
many occasions that he would like to one day work on helping other kids with
disabilities and in wheelchairs by being an engineer. Also, with an entity like
UCD being involved they would have a way to give back to a Davis student but it
would also show undergraduate students ways they can use their education to
support unique students. The student shared, "I hope that one day I will
be able to do the sports everyone else does. One day I want to maybe be an
engineer. I want to be able to help other kids in wheelchairs do stuff at
school and be with their friends."

The student's mother has given permission for him to take part, and if this
proposal is considered she'd like to meet with the UCD team and find out what
his participation in this class would look like. She was also open to the
undergraduates coming to meet and observe him to get a better understanding of
his abilities and needs. The teacher, the student and our PE staff sincerely
hope the Mechanical Engineering Department will consider this proposal for a
capstone project, because like the student, it is truly a unique opportunity.
