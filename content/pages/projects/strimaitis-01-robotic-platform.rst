FMC Technologies Schilling Robotics would like to sponsor a team of engineering
students in the UC Davis Mechanical Engineering Capstone Program. We are
proposing that this team completely rethink the design of a deep-submersible
pan and tilt device used on our remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to mount
cameras and lights. Project team members will gain unique experience with
designing equipment under the constraints imposed by creating submersible
robotic equipment that works at depths up to 6000 meters.

SCHILLING ROBOTICS BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
=======================================

FMC Technologies Schilling Robotics brings nearly 30 years of technological
expertise and innovation to the challenges that face customers in the subsea
environment. Our products are capable, reliable, and efficient, thus lowering
the cost of ownership for the life of each equipment item. Our ROVs,
manipulators, and control systems withstand the harshest conditions in the most
remote locations on Earth. We are committed to providing the highest standards
of reliability and service at every point in the product lifecycle. We value
our customers as partners, and believe that our success depends on our
customers' success.

THE PROBLEM WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO SOLVE
======================================

Our current pan and tilt, which has been in production for years, needs
improvement in many areas. The pan and tilt is expensive, has many parts, is
time-consuming and difficult to assemble, and requires extensive preparation
for submersion. We need you to completely rethink the pan and tilt design and
propose a revolutionary new design--something exciting that no one at Schilling
Robotics has imagined.

SCOPE
=====

At Schilling Robotics, we break up development into two major phases: (1)
coming up with ideas and proving them as viable approaches, and (2) adapting
chosen designs for subsea use. The pan and tilt project will focus on the first
phase, and will consist of exploring, brainstorming, and evaluating ideas, then
communicating those ideas to others through prototypes.

The project will focus on mechanical design, but the project team’s overall,
high-level direction must allow the integration of electrical and software
aspects as necessary to make the new pan and tilt usable on a Schilling ROV.
Schilling Robotics will do the minimal electrical (and possibly software) work
needed to support the mechanical development.

We understand that the project lasts less than 5 months, and we do not expect a
final design.

HOW SCHILLING ROBOTICS WILL SUPPORT YOUR PROJECT
================================================

- We will provide a tour of our facility’s product development area and
  production plant.
- Because the equipment development process must be creative, we will teach you
  Schilling’s “deep-dive” brainstorming technique.
- We will provide a mentor (a mechanical engineer) for the team. We will meet
  weekly throughout the project.
- Because Schilling Robotics’ product development process stresses prototype
  creation and design iteration, we will provide resources that include our
  prototype shop, laser cutter, 3D printer, machine shops, and vendor pipeline.
- Schilling’s product development group of over 50 people can be used as
  necessary throughout the project.
- We will pay for the project supplies (you will have no out-of-pocket
  expenses).
- Our entire product development group will provide valuable feedback when you
  give presentations for your ideas and prototypes. Tyler Schilling, the
  founder of Schilling Robotics, typically attends these presentations. He will
  be very interested in your design approach and prototypes.

SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
============================================

- Strong mechanical background.
- Self-motivated.
- Creative.
- Hands-on approach and able to build prototypes. This project is not about going
  into a machine shop and making beautiful parts. This project is about using
  available resources, materials, hardware and existing “stuff” to quickly make
  something new, confirm functionality, and communicate ideas. We are looking
  for people who consider themselves to be “makers.”
- Machine shops skills (not required, but a plus).
- Education (undergrad classes, in order of applicability) in physics,
  mechanical design, statics, pressure vessel design, dynamics, and
  mechatronics.
- Ability to apply basic electrical knowledge (to make electrical components
  function if necessary)
