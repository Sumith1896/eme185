We are an organic fruit farm in Davis and are in need of renewably powered,
ergonomic way to pick and transport fruit out of our orchard. We currently
spend a lot of time during harvest picking fruit on ladders and then repacking
it into boxes. We also drive a pick-up through the orchard to collect the
boxes, which compacts the ground near the trees and uses gasoline. We envision
a bike-powered harvest cart that would be able to traverse uneven ground, racks
that could hold up to 400 lbs in fruit at a time, and be able to transport
fruit without bruising it, perhaps using suspension. Ergonomically designed
holders for the picking trays would allow us to easily slide the trays into the
harvest cart racks. We would hope to have the following outcomes: a reduction
in labor costs, fuel usage, and soil compaction.
