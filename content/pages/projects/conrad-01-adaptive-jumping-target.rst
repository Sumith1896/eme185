We have done some research on repeated jumps and one of the challenges we have
had is getting the best effort from subjects on every single jump over 30+
seconds. I think one solution would be to have an adaptive target for subjects
to reach toward during the test. The key feature is that it would have to be
responsive to the performance of the individual so that it is always "just out
of reach" even as the subject fatigues and reduces their jump height. The
system would need to be able to detect the height of previous jumps, compute
the ideal height for target and then set the target height.
