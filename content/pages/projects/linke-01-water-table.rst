The watertable experiment is a simple yet effective method to visualize air
flow phenomena. It uses the hydraulic analogy, that the height of the water
column in the water table is related to the density of a two dimensional
compressible flow over a given object. There are two options to run the
experiment. The first is to move a model in a thin water layer. The other is to
fix the model and run the water around it. The water table experiment is very
inexpensive compared to high-speed wind tunnels. The theory is applicable in
transonic flows and the water table is used in Educational Institutes as well
as in Industry.

The aim of this project is to design a new water table to be used in a new
class on aerospace design and manufacturing. The course development and water
table design are part of  NSF award 1505080. This project is sponsored by Prof.
Barbara Linke and Prof. Mohamed Hafez in the Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering Department.

An outdated water table is available at UC Davis, but needs to be updated with
regard to mechanical design and embedded electronics. The tasks for preferably
two design teams are as follows:

- Design a water table that can be moved between different locations in Bainer
  Hall
- Implement safety measures for in-class demonstrations
- Implement a feed drive for the model
- Develop a quick-release model holder
- Design a water pump and die injectors (to color thin streams of water)
- Build an appropriate measurement /visualization device for the local height
  of the thin water layer
- Set-up the motors and controls with NI LabView
