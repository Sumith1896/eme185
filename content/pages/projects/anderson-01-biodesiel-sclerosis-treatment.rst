Biodiesel spoils (polymerizes) in less than a year and glues the fuel path in
diesel engines, killing the vehicle. We have a list of combustible solvents,
that when added to the fuel, reverse the polymerization process. The project
will involve testing various additives for biodesiel for adequte fuel injector
flow and/or combustion. The sponsor has row of dead vehicles with biodiesel
disease to test the new product on.

Other requirements
------------------

The sponsor has a lab and testing setup in Alameda and would like the students
to spend time there working on the projects, where they will be deployed. If
you select this project you will need to be willing to travel to Alameda using
your own means.
