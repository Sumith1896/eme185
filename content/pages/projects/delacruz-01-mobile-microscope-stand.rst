Microscope Services would like a microscope stand that is inertially stable but
movable so that a wheelchair bound user can bring it up to their chair. It has
to move smoothly and easily, but either have high inertia or be very good at
damping vibrations. Additionally, there will potentially need to be electronic
actuation for table height and mechanical safety locks. There are likely
funding opportunities from the University for the prototype.
