The typical trendy "tiny house on wheels" is not actually legal to occupy in
most towns, not legal to possess in Oakland and others. The structure becomes a
burden on the owner (my friends) when evicted. small agricultural membrane
structures are allowed, and could be designed to provide very adaptable
work/living space.

Other requirements
------------------

The sponsor has a lab and testing setup in Alameda and would like the students
to spend time there working on the projects, where they will be deployed. If
you select this project you will need to be willing to travel to Alameda using
your own means.
