Project description
===================

Residual stresses are present in many materials. Measuring residual stress in
materials is a very precise process. There are several semi-destructive methods
for measuring residual stress including hole-drilling and ring-coring. These
methods require a cutting tool to be oriented perpendicular to the surface of a
specimen for accurate residual stress measurement results. The existing device
used for hole-drilling and ring-coring measurements at Hill Engineering
incorporates a manually operated system capable of two rotational degrees of
freedom such that the end of the cutting tool is oriented normal to the
specimen surface.

This project will involve design, construction, and validation of a device to
automatically rotate a cutting tool to be perpendicular to the surface of a
test specimen. There shall be minimal operator action required for alignment.
The system shall operate in any orientation (i.e., mounted at up to 180-deg
from horizontal) and shall be rigid and capable of holding up to 40 lbs in any
orientation. When mounted, the system shall have the capability to rotate up to
+/- 10- deg and should be capable of resolving 0.1-deg of rotation over a
length of 12 mm. Additionally, the system should be capable of at least 75 mm
of translation parallel to the cutting tool axis. After adjustment, the system
must stay locked in place +/- 5 ÔÅ≠m. The system shall fit within a volume of 300
mm (L) x 300 mm (W) x 200 mm (H), shall have sufficient open space to fit a
cutting tool (details to be provided) and shall weigh less than 20 lbs. A
software interface is required to operate the alignment system. The software
should allow for automatic alignment as well as manual control of the system.

The project involves the following tasks:

- Define device capabilities: interact with company engineers to finalize the
  detailed requirements
- System design: identify candidate design approaches, weigh tradeoffs, and
  select final design
- Critical design reviews: present design to company for feedback and
  acceptance
- System prototype: prepare detailed system drawings, machine and manufacture
  components, assemble, develop software and control
- System validation: validate the performance of the device
- System documentation: provide design information and operation instructions
- Demonstration and training: provide on-site system demonstration and training
