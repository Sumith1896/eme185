Chickens are jungle fowl and thrive in the wild in proper conditions. The
project involves designing and building a coop which is fully self-tending. The
chickens should be able to pit themselves away for the night and it should be
impossible for predators to get the chickens. Furthermore, the coop will need
to have a self-tending run that allows them a place to kick droppings away and
be collected for a vermi-composting bin or other reuse.

Other requirements
------------------

The sponsor has a lab and testing setup in Alameda and would like the students
to spend time there working on the projects, where they will be deployed. If
you select this project you will need to be willing to travel to Alameda using
your own means.
